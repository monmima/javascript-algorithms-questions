# Javascript Algorithms: Questions

This is a repository with the answers to a bunch of algorithms.

The algorithms in this repository were gathered by Dylan Israel and turned into a Udemy Course [called the 100 Algorithm's Challenge Course](https://github.com/PizzaPokerGuy/100AlgorithmsChallenge), which has an official [repository on Github](https://github.com/PizzaPokerGuy/100AlgorithmsChallenge). Go to [Dylan's Web site](http://www.dylanisrael.com/) before you buy the course, because he might have a promo code for you to use.

This repository is basically my answers to his challenges. I have done about half of them so far, but unfortunately I have started this repository much later in the process.

Oh, and by the way, for the challenges I don't use TypeScript, which is of course optional.

**Difficulty level**

I want to use a classification system as much as possible in my files to know how hard a challenge is for me. This way, I can come back to stuff that is harder for me. The rating will be: easy, medium or hard.

**Quokka.js**

Finally, I used the Quokka.js extension for Visual Studio Code to get the output for my algorithms directly in the JS file instead of the browser.
